participant_1_name: JUANLI CARRIÓN
participant_1_text: "Juanli Carrión is a New York-based artist born in Yecla, Spain.
  His site-specific interventions aesthetically respond to the social, political,
  and cultural history of their sites, gathering people, actions, information and
  geography to reconstruct “the landscape” generated by its inherent conflicts with
  a strong focus on social and environmental justice. In 2017 he founded OSS Project,
  Inc, a non-profit organization that started in 2014 as a series of site-specific
  public interventions in the form of geopolitical gardens that materialize social
  ecosystems through the use of different plant species as representatives of social
  groups or individuals. \nCarrión is a faculty member at Parsons, The New School
  where he teaches Sustainable Design. He has also participated in lectures, panels,
  workshops and master classes at institutions like Columbia University, Open Engagement
  at Carnegie Mellon University, SVA, Pratt Institute, SUNY, NYU, AIA New York Cener
  for Architecture, Fordham Graduate School for Social Service, Wavehill o Apexart,
