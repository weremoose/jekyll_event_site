  geography to reconstruct “the landscape” generated by its inherent conflicts with
  a strong focus on social and environmental justice. In 2017 he founded OSS Project,
  Inc, a non-profit organization that started in 2014 as a series of site-specific
  public interventions in the form of geopolitical gardens that materialize social
  ecosystems through the use of different plant species as representatives of social
  groups or individuals. \nCarrión is a faculty member at Parsons, The New School

## IECES 2019

**The International Encounters of Community and Environmental Sociology** will take place this year, once again, **in** the rural Swedish village of **Uddebo from the 4th through the 7th of July.** This meeting will serve as a site for participants to exchange and share their experiences and to discuss the future of independent cultural frameworks.

The second edition of International Encounters of Community and Environmental Sociology, New Forms of Contemplation for a New Society, continues to develop, as in the previous edition, as an interdisciplinary space of conversation on how to create new approaches in cultural policies based on the models of the auto-sustainable infrastructures. We have chosen Uddebo as the base of the IECES because we view Uddebo as an inspiring place where one can visualize the ecooperative development of the neighbourhood in helping to organize, enhance, and strengthen the participation of the community. The focus of the event’s program will consist of non-activities, experiences, and participation in the local and social milieu of Uddebo and its surroundings.

For this second edition of International Encounters we have selected a group of international experts specializing in the field of art and culture whose labor is based in the independent cultural framework. Our participants range from artists, thinkers, academics, curators, composers, and architects. The project hopes to bridge the local and the international through creating a place for meeting and conversation between participants in the symposium and members of the Uddebo community. International Encounters creates an opportunity for those involved to share their experiences related to the development of art and cultural projects that are integrated in community and environmental sociology with voices represented both from Uddebo and a larger international community.

The goal of the project is to develop in both the public and private sphere a collective thought or aim that will serve as an important tool in improving the relationship between sustainable development and social integration with the quality of culture. In fact, International Encounters views the relationship between culture and sustainable development an imperative. Bringing various participants together to discuss this topic will serve to create a larger transnational discourse on the imperative to merge cultural thought, sustainable development, and social integration.

The project channels the collective intelligence and viewpoints of each participant and therefore will help to develop and improve the quality of art and culture by contrasting and channeling each participants unique ideas and perspectives.  
The project aims to create and foster a cultural and artistic ecosystem with a very active link with the non-state public culture. In this ecosystem the various actors are engaged in a social system outside of the practice of consumption. More specifically, we want to reflect on the systematic dimensions of building a sustainable culture in communities where societies can develop in a direction towards a post-human perspective and a meeting place for the exchange of experiences of participants, whose objective will be to consider the future of this great independent cultural framework.  
Producing this event can be viewed in tandem with several of our previous projects where we consider similar themes. For example, our latest work was the creation of a nonprofit organization whose work focuses on promoting research in the sciences and humanities that strives to improve the quality of interaction of all living beings belonging to the same social ecosystem.  
This gathering will allow participants to share projects, meet potential collaborators, and find the inspiration to work collectively to consolidate a base for a future network of collaborations between the participating actors and the inhabitants belonging to the Uddebo community.
