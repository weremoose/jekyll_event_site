# An event theme adapted for Jekyll and Forestry

The theme used for this site is an adapted version of the [New Event](https://templatemo.com/tm-486-new-event) theme. It is a theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) originally adapted from the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). It is now set up to work with [Forrestry.io]() and multiple event pages can be created using the same layout.

## How to use

* You can edit and add new entries like Google Analytics, Jekyll plugins in the `_config.yml` to suit your needs.
* Events are added as pages. 
* The title of the page is going to be used in the URL by default.
* Images are added into the "image" folder. That is the folder used for the Media section in forestry. [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used for better performance.
*
