# An event theme adapted for Jekyll and Forestry

The theme used for this site is an adapted version of the [New Event](https://templatemo.com/tm-486-new-event) theme. It is a theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) originally adapted from the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). It is now set up to work with [Forrestry.io]() and multiple event pages can be created using the same layout.

## How to use

* You can edit and add new entries like Google Analytics, Jekyll plugins in the `_config.yml` to suit your needs.
* Events are added as pages.
* The name of the page (.md file under the Pages section) is going to be used in the URL by default. For the current event page that will be the home page of the site, always use index.md
* Images are added into the "image" folder. That is the folder used for the Media section in forestry. [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used for better performance.
*
